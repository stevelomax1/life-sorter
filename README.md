The Life Sorter (Workday Scheduler)

This site was designed to be a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). 

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
HTML and CSS are used as the started code foundation however Javascript is what I used to power the code and to give my app functionality.

The workday scheduler will be a helpful tool for those with busy schedules that want more structure and time management.
